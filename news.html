    According to the Sustainable Development Goals Report, the number of people experiencing hunger and food insecurity has been increasing since 2015, worsened by the pandemic and climate change. In 2022, approximately 9.2% of the global population, or 735 million people, faced chronic hunger, which was 122 million more than in 2019. Additionally, about 2.4 billion people (29.6% of the world) were moderately or severely food insecure, indicating they lacked access to adequate food, which is 391 million more than in 2019.
